## Introduction 

With a large volume of __smartwatches__ and __phones__ being manufactured, there is a huge amount of data generated by them. In fact, smartwatches have various sensors that would track activities of users. With the aid of machine learning and deep learning, human activity could be predicted. In addition, mobile phones are using machine learning to detect the chances of users driving a car or not. There are many other interesting applications which are discussed in the notebook.

## Machine Learning Analysis
In this project, I am going to be working with machine learning and deep learning algorithms that would predict the activity performed by users based on the tracking data.
